\section{Improvements to Upper and Lower Bounds}

Theorem \cref{theo:ring-loading-algorithm} guarantees that the solution provided by \cref{algo:rl} is not greater than $L^\mathrm{opt}\frac{3}{2} D$.
However, it is not clear that this upper bound is tight.
In this section we will examine this upper bound in greater detail.
Practically speaking, we are looking for the infimum $\alpha \in \R$ that satisfies the following expression:

\begin{equation}
	...
\end{equation}

\citet{skutella16} improved the upper bound to $\frac{19}{14} \approx 1.35$ and the lower bound to $1.1$.
\Todo{Maybe show skutella example for lower bound.}
Most recently, \citet{daubel19} further improved the upper bound to $1.3$.
