\section{The Constant}

Theorem \cref{theo:ring-loading-algorithm} guarantees that the solution provided by \cref{algo:rl} is not greater than $L^\mathrm{opt}\frac{3}{2} D$.
However, it is not clear that this upper bound is tight.
In this section we will examine this upper bound in greater detail.
Practically speaking, we are looking for the infimum $\alpha \in \R$ that satisfies the following expression:
