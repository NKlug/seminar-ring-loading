\section{An Algorithm for Ring Loading}

The idea for solving an instance of \RL is the following:
First, we compute a solution to the same instance in \RRL.
As \cref{lemma:number-of-split-demands} states, \cref{algo:rrl} yields a solution $\phi$ in which at most $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ demands are split; the remainder is either routed all front or all back.
Now, we iteratively unsplit those demands.
Of course, this does not always yield the optimal solution $L^\mathrm{opt}$ to the ring loading instance.
However, the way in which we unsplit the demands approximates $L^\mathrm{opt}$ with an additive error of at most $\frac{3}{2}D$, where $D$ is the largest demand.

The procedure for unsplitting is given in \cref{algo:rl}.

The following theorem and its proof guarantee the quality of the produced solution.
\begin{theorem}
	\label{theo:ring-loading-algorithm}
	Let $I$ be an instance of size $n$ of \RL, $D$ its largest demand and $L^\mathrm{opt}$ its optimal solution.
	Then \cref{algo:rl} computes a solution to $I$ with maximum load $L \leq L^\mathrm{opt} + \frac{3}{2} D$ in $\cO(?)$ time using $\cO(?)$ space.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	TBD
\end{proof}
