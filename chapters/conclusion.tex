\section{Conclusion}

In this work, the approximation algorithm for \RL by \citet{schrijver99} was presented.
On the way, we have seen how a minimal solution to \RRL can be determined.


\citet{khanna97} uses this algorithm to obtain a PTAS for \RL.

To this day, the exact upper bound remains an open question.
