\section{Introduction}

In this work, the 1999 paper "The Ring Loading Problem" by Schrijver and Seymour will be presented and discussed.
This will be the introduction.

This work is based on \citet{schrijver99}.

Already shown: Tight bound $L^\mathrm{opt} \leq 2 L^\ast$ (take references from d√§ubel intro!! TODO).

\citet{schrijver99} achieve an additive bound of $L^\mathrm{opt} + \frac{3}{2}D$.
This bound has since been improved to $1.3$ but the improvement based on the same algorithm.
It is therefore still sensible to review and understand the algorithm presented by \citet{schrijver99} in the late 1990s.
