\section{Ring Graphs and Terminology}

"Cycle Graph"

A \emph{ring of size $n$} is an undirected graph with the vertex set that corresponds to the integer equivalence classes modulo $n$ and edges $\{[i], [i+1]\}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$.
For simplicity we write $i$ instead of $[i]$ and $\{i, i+1\}$ for the $i$-th edge. 

Ring as weighted chords + image.

$[n]$ is the standard $n$-set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
