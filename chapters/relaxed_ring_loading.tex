\section{An Algorithm for Relaxed Ring Loading}

\begin{definition}
	An optimal solution $\phi^\ast$ to \RRL is said to be \emph{minimal} if for every other optimal there exists at least one $1 \leq i \leq n$ for which $L_i' > L_i^\ast$.
\end{definition}
This definition is equivalent for a minimal solution $\phi^\ast$ there exists no other optimal solution with $L_i' \leq L_i^\ast$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $L_j' < L_j^\ast$ for at least one $j$.

If a routing $\phi^\ast$ routes traffic of the demand $d_{ij}$ through the front and the back route, that is if $\phi^\ast$ $\phi^\ast(i, j) \in (0, 1)$, we say that $\phi^\ast$is \emph{splits} the demand $d_{ij}$.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theo:parallel-demands-non-crossing}
	Let $\phi^\ast$ be a minimal solution to an instance of \RRL.
	Then no link in between two parallel demands $d_{ij}$ and $d_{gh}$ carries traffic from both demands.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\phi^\ast$ be a minimal solution.
	Assume that the link $\{k, k+1\}$ lies in between the demands $d_{ij}$ and $d_{gh}$ and that $\phi^\ast$ routes traffic from both demands through $\{k, k+1\}$.
	Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the amounts of traffic from $d_{ij}$ and $d_{gh}$, respectively, that is routed through $\{k, k+1\}$.
	Furthermore, assume without loss of generality that $\alpha \leq \beta$.
	We now construct a new routing $\phi'$ from $\phi^\ast$ by rerouting traffic $\alpha$ of both demands such that it no longer passes through $\{k, k+1\}$.
	\Todo{Explain the cases how parallel demands can occur, and when \{k, k+1\} must lie on the back and when on the front route}
	Then $\{k, k+1\}$ no longer carries traffic from $d_{ij}$ and the new load on this link is $L_k' = L_k^\ast - 2 \alpha < L_k^\ast$.
	
	\input{figures/parallel_demands}
	
	Parallel demands can occur in three types of configurations, which can be seen in \cref{fig:parallel-demands}.
	We distinguish the three cases:
	\begin{enumerate}[align=left]
		\item[\textbf{Cases 1 and 2:} $[i, j) \subset [g, h)$ or $[g, h) \subset [i,j)$]{\mbox{}\\
			We assume $[i, j) \subset [g, h)$; the other case is reasoned analogously.
			Then the rerouting of the traffic results $\phi'$ given by
			\begin{align}
				\phi'(i, j) = 1 \ ,\quad
				\phi'(g, h) = \frac{\beta - \alpha}{d_{gh}}
			\end{align}
			and $\phi'(u, v) = \phi^\ast(u, v)$ for all other demands $d_{uv}$.
			For all $1 \leq m \leq n$, the new link loads are given by
			\begin{equation}
				L_m' = L_m^\ast + \alpha (\dOne_{\{m \in [i, j)\}} - \dOne_{\{m \notin [i, j)\}} + 
				\dOne_{\{m \notin [g, h)\}} - \dOne_{\{m \in [g, h)\}}) \ ,
			\end{equation}
			$\dOne$ being the indicator function.
			If $m \in [i, j)$, then $m \in [g, h)$ and $L_m' = L_m^\ast$.
			If $m \notin [i, j)$, then  $L_m' \leq L_m^\ast$.
		}
		\item[\textbf{Case 3:} $[i, j) \cap [g, h) = \emptyset$]{\mbox{}\\
			In this case the routing $\phi'$ is given by
			\Todo{Explain where this comes from}
			\begin{align}
				\phi'(i, j) = 1 \ ,\quad
				\phi'(g, h) = 1 - \frac{\beta - \alpha}{d_{gh}}
			\end{align}
			and $\phi'(u, v) = \phi^\ast(u, v)$ for all other demands $d_{uv}$.
			The new link loads are given by
			\begin{equation}
				L_m' = L_m^\ast + \alpha (\dOne_{\{m \in [i, j)\}} - \dOne_{\{m \notin [i, j)\}} + 
				\dOne_{\{m \in [g, h)\}} - \dOne_{\{m \notin [g, h)\}}) \ .
			\end{equation}
			Similar to the cases 1 and 2, we get $L_m' \leq L_m^\ast$, as we assumed that $[i, j) \cap [g, h) = \emptyset$.
		}
	\end{enumerate}
	In total, the routing $\phi'$ has link loads $L_m' \leq L_m^\ast$ for all $1 \leq m \leq n$ and $L_k' < L_k^\ast$.
	This contradicts the minimality of $\phi^\ast$.
\end{proof}

We can imagine a cut $\{i, j\}$ as a chord connecting the link $\{i, i+1\}$ with the link $\{j, j+1\}$ and can therefore also use the same terms to describe their properties as for demands, such as \emph{crossing} and \emph{parallel}.

\begin{definition}
	The \emph{demand across the cut} $\{g, h\}$ is the sum of demands with endpoints on both sides of the cut:
	\begin{equation}
		D_{gh} \coloneqq \sum_{d_{ij} \in \{d_{ij}\ |\ \abs{[i, j) \cap (g, h]} = 1\}} 
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cut Condition]
	A cut $\{g, h\}$ is said to satisfy the \emph{cut condition} if
	\begin{equation}
		D_{gh} \leq C_g + C_h
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

In an instance of \RRL, is there is a cut $\{g, h\}$ which violates the cut condition, the instance is not solvable:
The links $\{g, g+1\}$ and $\{h, h+1\}$ pose a bottleneck to the demands that cross the cut and hinder every demand from being satisfied.


\begin{theorem}
	\label{theo:cut-condition}
	Let $I$ be an instance of \RRL.
	If all cuts in $I$ satisfy the cut condition, $I$ is solvable.
\end{theorem}
For the proof, we will need the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}
	Let $\{g, h\}$, $\{g', h'\}$ be two parallel cuts.
	Then every demand crosses as many of the cuts $\{g, h\}$, $\{g', h'\}$ as it crosses cuts $\{g, g'\}, \{h, h'\}$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	By distinction of cases.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{theo:cut-condition}]
	We conduct the proof by assuming there are instances that satisfy the cut condition, but are not solvable.
	Let $I$ be the smallest of these instances in terms of ring size $n$ and the number of non-zero demands.
	
	Pick any non-zero demand $d_ij$ and let 
\end{proof}

\input{figures/rll_algorithm}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theo:rll-algo-correct}
	Let $I$ be an instance of size $n$ of \RRL that satisfies the cut condition.
	Then \cref{algo:rll} computes a minimal solution of $I$ in $\cO(?)$ time using $\cO(?)$ space.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	TBD
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	At the end of \cref{algo:rll} at most $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ demands are split.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\phi^\ast$ be the minimal routing that results from the execution of \cref{algo:rll}.
	Furthermore, let $S \coloneqq \{(i, j)\ |\ d_{ij}\ \text{is split by}\ \phi^\ast \}$ and $(i, j), (g, h) \in S$.
	If the demands $d_{ij}$ and $d_{gh}$ were parallel, there would be a link $\{k, k+1\}$ that carries traffic from both demands, as they both are split.
	However, it follows from the minimality of $\phi^\ast$ and \cref{theo:parallel-demands-non-crossing} that this cannot be the case, which implies that $d_{ij}$ and $d_{gh}$ are crossing.
	This can, by definition, only occur if $i, j, g, h$ are mutually distinct.
	
	This implies that every $1 \leq i \leq n$ can occur in at most one tuple in $S$.
	As the tuples in $S$ each consist of two elements, there can be at most $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ such tuples.
\end{proof}
